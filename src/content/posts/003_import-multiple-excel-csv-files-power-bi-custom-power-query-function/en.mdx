### Introduction

Importing and combining multiple Excel or CSV files into Power BI or Excel can quickly become a headache. Fortunately, Power Query offers connectors like "Folder" or "SharePoint Folder" to retrieve and merge files stored locally or on SharePoint/Teams. However, these connectors sometimes add too many unnecessary queries, which can complicate data management.

In this article, we will cover:

- How to use the ‚ÄúSharePoint folder‚Äù connector to import and combine files
- Why this method can become polluting
- A cleaner and optimized alternative using a custom Power Query function

<br />
### Using the "SharePoint Folder" Connector

Generally, when you want to import and combine multiple CSV or Excel files, you use the "Folder" connector (for local files) or "SharePoint Folder" (for files stored on SharePoint/Teams).

Let's take a concrete example: imagine you have several financial data files stored in a SharePoint folder, separated by country.

</Note>

<br />
##### Traditional Import Process

1. In the Ribbon menu, click: `Home > New Source > More...`
2. Search for "SharePoint Folder"
3. Select it and click "Connect"
4. Enter your SharePoint site link (or use a Power Query parameter)

    alt="Sharepoint Folder Connector"
/>

5. Click OK then "Transform Data"
6. In the "Folder Path" column, filter to select the folder containing your files
7. Click the double arrows in the first column to combine all files

    alt="First Example"
/>

**üéØ Problem:** At this stage, you'll notice that Power Query creates numerous folders, queries, and functions. This is where it becomes problematic: with each similar import, you end up with a multiplication of elements that "pollute" your Power Query editor.

üí° Solution? Create a custom Power Query function!

### Workaround with a Custom Power Query Function

The idea is to have a single clean and optimized query that imports and combines all files without unnecessary pollution. To solve this problem, I developed a utility Power Query function that allows importing and combining Excel files stored on SharePoint or Teams more cleanly.

##### Power Query Function Code

```powerquery
let
    ImportAndCombineExcelFiles = (
        Source as table, folderPath as list, fileExtension as text, SheetOrTableName as text, filterColumnName as text
    ) =>
        let
            NavigateToFolder = List.Accumulate(
                folderPath, Source, (current, item) => current{[Name = item]}[Content]
            ),
            FilterByExtension = Table.SelectRows(NavigateToFolder, each ([Extension] = "." & fileExtension)),
            AddWorkbookContent = Table.AddColumn(FilterByExtension, "Tables", each Excel.Workbook([Content])),
            KeepFileNameAndTables = Table.SelectColumns(AddWorkbookContent, {"Name", "Tables"}),
            RenameFileNameColumn = Table.RenameColumns(KeepFileNameAndTables, {{"Name", "FileName"}}),
            ExpandTablesColumn = Table.ExpandTableColumn(
                RenameFileNameColumn, "Tables", {"Name", "Data"}, {"Name", "Data"}
            ),
            FilterByTableName = Table.SelectRows(ExpandTablesColumn, each ([Name] = SheetOrTableName)),
            ExpandDataColumn =
                let
                    data = FilterByTableName{0}[Data],
                    columns = Table.ColumnNames(data),
                    expanded = Table.ExpandTableColumn(FilterByTableName, "Data", columns, columns)
                in
                    expanded,
            RemoveNameColumn = Table.RemoveColumns(ExpandDataColumn, {"Name"}),
            PromoteHeaders = Table.PromoteHeaders(RemoveNameColumn, [PromoteAllScalars = true]),
            FilterOutHeaderRows = Table.SelectRows(
                PromoteHeaders, each (Record.Field(_, filterColumnName) <> filterColumnName)
            ),
            firstColumnName = Table.ColumnNames(FilterOutHeaderRows){0},
            RenameFirstColumn = Table.RenameColumns(FilterOutHeaderRows, {{firstColumnName, "FileName"}})
        in
            RenameFirstColumn
in
    ImportAndCombineExcelFiles
```

Detailed Function Explanation

**üìå Function Signature**

```powerquery
ImportAndCombineExcelFiles = (
    Source as table, folderPath as list, fileExtension as text, SheetOrTableName as text, filterColumnName as text
) => ...
```

This function takes **5 parameters**:

1. **`Source` (table)**: The data source (typically a SharePoint or Teams folder).
2. **`folderPath` (list)**: A list of subfolders to navigate to the target location.
3. **`fileExtension` (text)**: The extension of files to import (e.g., `"xlsx"`).
4. **`SheetOrTableName` (text)**: The name of the target table in each Excel file (e.g., Excel sheet/table name).
5. **`filterColumnName` (text)**: The name of the column that will be used to filter duplicate header rows (a column present in all files).

---

**üìå Step Explanation**

1Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate to the target folder

```powerquery
NavigateToFolder = List.Accumulate(
    folderPath, Source, (current, item) => current{[Name = item]}[Content]
),
```

- Use `List.Accumulate` to **navigate through the subfolders** specified in `folderPath`.
- At each step, select the subfolder until reaching the final location.

---

2Ô∏è‚É£ Filter files by extension

```powerquery
FilterByExtension = Table.SelectRows(NavigateToFolder, each ([Extension] = "." & fileExtension)),
```

- Filter files to keep only those with the specified extension (e.g., `.xlsx`).

---

3Ô∏è‚É£ Extract tables from each Excel file

```powerquery
AddWorkbookContent = Table.AddColumn(FilterByExtension, "Tables", each Excel.Workbook([Content])),
```

- Use `Excel.Workbook([Content])` to extract all **tables and worksheets** from Excel files.

---

4Ô∏è‚É£ Select only files and their tables

```powerquery
KeepFileNameAndTables = Table.SelectColumns(AddWorkbookContent, {"Name", "Tables"}),
RenameFileNameColumn = Table.RenameColumns(KeepFileNameAndTables, {{"Name", "FileName"}}),
```

- Keep only two columns:
  - `Name` (file name)
  - `Tables` (file content)
- Rename `Name` to `FileName` to avoid confusion.

---

5Ô∏è‚É£ Expand the table column

```powerquery
ExpandTablesColumn = Table.ExpandTableColumn(
    RenameFileNameColumn, "Tables", {"Name", "Data"}, {"Name", "Data"}
),
```

- **Expand** the `Tables` column to extract table names and their data (`Data`).

---

6Ô∏è‚É£ Filter only the desired table

```powerquery
FilterByTableName = Table.SelectRows(ExpandTablesColumn, each ([Name] = SheetOrTableName)),
```

- **Keep only** the table whose name matches `SheetOrTableName`.

---

7Ô∏è‚É£ Expand the `Data` column (table data)

```powerquery
ExpandDataColumn =
    let
        data = FilterByTableName{0}[Data],
        columns = Table.ColumnNames(data),
        expanded = Table.ExpandTableColumn(FilterByTableName, "Data", columns, columns)
    in
        expanded,
```

- Retrieve the **first row** containing data (`Data`).
- Extract the **column names**.
- **Unfold** the table using the column names.

---

8Ô∏è‚É£ Remove the table name column

```powerquery
RemoveNameColumn = Table.RemoveColumns(ExpandDataColumn, {"Name"}),
```

- Remove the `Name` column as it is no longer necessary.

---

9Ô∏è‚É£ Promote headers

```powerquery
PromoteHeaders = Table.PromoteHeaders(RemoveNameColumn, [PromoteAllScalars = true]),
```

- Use `Table.PromoteHeaders` to **transform the first row into column headers**.

---

üîü Remove duplicate header rows

```powerquery
FilterOutHeaderRows = Table.SelectRows(
    PromoteHeaders, each (Record.Field(_, filterColumnName) <> filterColumnName)
),
```

- Remove **rows where the `filterColumnName` column contains its own name** (these often correspond to header duplicates from Excel files).

---

1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Rename the first column to `FileName`

```powerquery
firstColumnName = Table.ColumnNames(FilterOutHeaderRows){0},
RenameFirstColumn = Table.RenameColumns(FilterOutHeaderRows, {{firstColumnName, "FileName"}})
```

- Identify the **first column** of the final table.
- Rename it to `"FileName"` to keep track of the data origin.

##### Adding the Function to Our Previous Example

1. In the ribbon menu, click `Home > New Source > Blank Query`.
2. Select the query and click `Home > New Source > Advanced Editor`.
3. Replace all the code with the code block above.
4. Rename the function as you wish. Personally, I name functions with explicit names, for example: `fxImportAndCombineMultipleExcelFilesFromSharepointOrTeams`

<PostImage
    src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21b9f16e-d08c-4336-8623-44f272f97f90"
    alt="Power Query Function"
/>

And that's it! The function is ready to use. üéâ

### Using the function to import and combine Excel files

To use our new function:

1. Create a new blank query (Home > New Source > Blank Query)
2. Open Advanced Editor
3. Copy and paste the function code
4. Rename as you wish. In this example, we'll call it "MyData"

<PostImage
    src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af3e7585-2238-417d-ba95-dd06df45f3d4"
    alt="MyData Query"
/>

```powerquery
let
    Source = SharePoint.Contents("YOUR_SHAREPOINT_SITE_LINK", [ApiVersion = 15]),
    ImportAndCombineFiles = fxImportAndCombineMultipleExcelFilesFromSharepointOrTeams(
        Source, {"Shared Documents", "General", "FinancialSample"}, "xlsx", "Sheet1", "Segment"
    )
in
    ImportAndCombineFiles
```

Explanation

1Ô∏è‚É£ Defining the SharePoint source:
   ```powerquery
   Source = SharePoint.Contents("YOUR_SHAREPOINT_SITE_LINK", [ApiVersion = 15])
   ```
   - **SharePoint.Contents**: This function retrieves content from a specified SharePoint site.
   - **"YOUR_SHAREPOINT_SITE_LINK"**: Replace this text with your SharePoint site URL.
   - **[ApiVersion = 15]**: Specifies version 15 of the SharePoint API to use for data extraction.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Calling the `fxImportAndCombineMultipleExcelFilesFromSharepointOrTeams` function:
   ```powerquery
   ImportAndCombineFiles = fxImportAndCombineMultipleExcelFilesFromSharepointOrTeams(
       Source, {"Shared Documents", "General", "FinancialSample"}, "xlsx", "Sheet1", "Segment"
   )
   ```
   - **Source**: The previously defined source containing SharePoint site data.
   - **`{"Shared Documents", "General", "FinancialSample"}`**: The folder path in SharePoint where Excel files are located.
   - **"xlsx"**: The file extension to import (here, Excel files).
   - **"Sheet1"**: The worksheet name to extract from each Excel file.
   - **"Segment"**: The column used to filter rows in each file (in this example, the first column of our Excel files).

    src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/569eca1c-f153-4d8b-a051-60c547926ece"
    alt="Second Example"
/>

And there you have it, files are automatically imported and combined into a single query. Pretty clean and efficient, right? üòé


### Bonus ‚Äì Adaptation for CSV Files

For CSV files, here is a modified version of the function that takes a custom separator into account. Feel free to test it and adapt it to your specific needs:

```powerquery
let
    ImportAndCombineCSVFiles = (Source as table, folderPath as list, fileExtension as text, separator as text, filterColumnName as text) =>
        let
            NavigateToFolder = List.Accumulate(
                folderPath, Source, (current, item) => current{[Name = item]}[Content]
            ),
            FilterByExtension = Table.SelectRows(NavigateToFolder, each ([Extension] = "." & fileExtension)),
            AddCSVContent = Table.AddColumn(
                FilterByExtension, "Tables", each Csv.Document([Content], [Delimiter = separator])
            ),
            KeepFileNameAndTables = Table.SelectColumns(AddCSVContent, {"Name", "Tables"}),
            RenameFileNameColumn = Table.RenameColumns(KeepFileNameAndTables, {{"Name", "FileName"}}),
            ExpandTablesColumn =
                let
                    data = RenameFileNameColumn{0}[Tables],
                    columns = Table.ColumnNames(data),
                    expanded = Table.ExpandTableColumn(RenameFileNameColumn, "Tables", columns, columns)
                in
                    expanded,
            PromoteHeaders = Table.PromoteHeaders(ExpandTablesColumn, [PromoteAllScalars = true]),
            FilterOutHeaderRows = Table.SelectRows(
                PromoteHeaders, each (Record.Field(_, filterColumnName) <> filterColumnName)
            ),
            firstColumnName = Table.ColumnNames(FilterOutHeaderRows){0},
            RenameFirstColumn = Table.RenameColumns(FilterOutHeaderRows, {{firstColumnName, "FileName"}})
        in
            RenameFirstColumn
in
    ImportAndCombineCSVFiles
```

üìù And there you go! You can now import and merge CSV files just as easily as Excel files. üöÄ

### Conclusion

In this article, we explored a workaround solution to efficiently import and combine multiple Excel/CSV files stored on SharePoint or Teams, using a custom Power Query function. This approach solves several common problems encountered when importing multiple files:

- Reducing Power Query editor pollution
- Simplifying the file import process
- Creating a unique and reusable method for data import
